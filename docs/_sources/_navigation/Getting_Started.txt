Getting Started
===============

System Requirements
-------------------
Your System needs to support OpenGL 4.3.

Prerequisites
-------------
Before start you should be familiar with GitHub.
If you are not I recommend to go through the following explanations: https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary .
Make sure that you fully understand the following keywords:

- Branch
- Clone
- Fork

If you want to become a contributor or even a collaborator you should also understand:

- Commit
- Fetch
- Merge
- Pull (Fetch + Merge in one command)
- Upstream
- Pull Request

Github User Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you don't have a GitHub User Account, Sign up for one. You will need it to fork the project and stay up-to-date.

Eclipse Mars IDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The recommended IDE is Eclipse Mars https://eclipse.org/mars . 

.. note::
	You can also use Oxygen or Neon, but the following instructions for setting up the project are based on Mars.
